# My Garden

My Garden is a React, Typescript, HTML and CSS based mini-web app designed to allow users to see 12 different types of plants they can add to their garden, and filter for these items based on **type** or **hours of sunlight needed** and sort the plants based on **height**. The app is responsive but meant to be viewed on a desktop.

**To run it:**
Make sure you're in the main directory and run `npm run dev`
